# Flagged Directory

This directory is created by Gradio to store flagged examples from the web interface.

When users interact with the Gradio app (`app.py`) and flag certain inputs or outputs, 
they will be saved here for review and analysis.

Initially empty, this directory will be populated as users flag examples during app usage.
